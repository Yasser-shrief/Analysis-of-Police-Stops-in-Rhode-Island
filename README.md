# Analysis of Police Stops in Rhode Island

This study is an analysis of police stops in Rhode Island and covers more than 91,000 police stops conducted between the years 2005 and 2015. In this article, I analyzed a data set using Pandas in order to figure out whether race, age, gender, time of the day and other factors were effective in the decision made by the police to make the stop. After some iterations, I decided to analyze the effect of gender and leave the rest of the parameters for future studies.

I tried to examine whether police officers are less likely to issue traffic tickets to men or to women during traffic stops. In the conventional wisdom, it is widely accepted that women are less likely to receive tickets. Then I tried to analyze the results about police search and arrest rates.

The dataset of traffic stops in Rhode Island that was collected by the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) ., which is free and open to the public. Itâ€™s where people discover data, share analysis, and team up on everything from social bot detection to award-winning data journalism.
